    <h1>Cookie Recipe</h1>
    <p>

        Browning the butter gives the cookies a more intensely nutty, butterscotch flavor.
        Chopping the chocolate by hand creates large and small pieces for more textural and flavor contrast.
        An overnight rest allows enzymes to break down large carbohydrates, enhancing the caramelization and browning process the next day to help the cookies develop deeper flavor.
        Tearing apart and recombining the dough makes a rougher surface for craggier cookies.
